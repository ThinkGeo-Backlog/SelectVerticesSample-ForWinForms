# #  Select Vertices Sample  for WinForms

### Description

The purpose of this sample is to help you, the developer understand some intricacies of inheriting from EditInteractiveOverlay when implementing your own editing logic. Here we show how to keep control points drawing as selected even after the dragging operation is finished. For this purpose, we need to override three protected functions, OnControlPointSelected, MouseUpCore and DrawCore. Please, read carefully the comments to understand the inner workings of EditInteractiveOverlay.
